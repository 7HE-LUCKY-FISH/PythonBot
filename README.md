# Magic The Gathering Lookup Bot

A Discord bot that displays MTG card information including Oracle text, pictures, mana cost, and format legalities. I created this discord bot due to many of my friends playing Magic The Gathering regularly and introducing me to the game so I decided to apply some of my coding skills to help them with their games and so here we are.
Future I will try to add mana symbols instead of just having text.
Currently the bot is invite-only due to the cost of me hosting it 24/7 I wish more people could use it.
## Features

- Card image display
- Oracle text lookup
- Mana cost information
- Format legalities (Commander and Standard)
- Support for transform/double-faced cards
- Price information
## beta 5/13/24
- Calls API and shows text legalities and interactions

## fixing 8/11/24
- Made the image printing so they are together with pillow library and fused the images if there is a transformation ie(two-sided card)
